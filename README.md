# sketch-magnetic-poetry

This is a multiplayer magnetic poetry web toy, running at [magnetic-poetry.use-fireproof.com](https://magnetic-poetry.use-fireproof.com).

Users can drag and drop word tiles in collaboration with others in the same room. You can choose to save poems to the attached Fireproof database. Click the ðŸ”¥ link to see your data in the database.

## Experimental!

This app was created during [Matt](https://interconnected.org)'s summer 2023 residency. The purpose is to experiment with multiplayer interactions, and simultaneously see what PartyKit can do. It's called a sketch because it's lightweight and quick, and because we learn something in making it.

## What you'll find here

This app is based on Next.js and PartyKit.

To share state, PartyKit keeps a `Poem` object in party-side storage. When a client connects, it receives the entire object in a websocket message called `sync`. When a client makes a turn, the new tile is added to the mosaic, and broadcast to all others in the room as an `update` message.

Saved poems are archived to the database and the raw data can be accessed by clicking the ðŸ”¥ link.

To see this code:

- server (party-side): `src/partykit/server.ts`
- client: `src/app/Room.ts`

You can see the database connection in `src/app/Room.ts`: `connect.partykit(database, process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PARTYKIT_HOST!)`

And see how to configure PartyKit for Fireproof in `partykit.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "magnetic",
  "main": "src/partykit/server.ts",
  "parties": {
    "fireproof": "node_modules/@fireproof/partykit/src/server.ts"
  }
}
```

## To run this locally

Clone the repo, then (assuming you have Node.js installed):

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # tells the app where to find the partyserver
npx partykit dev  # runs the partyserver
npm run dev       # runs the app
```

Then go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the app (check out multiplayer by opening multiple browser windows).

The state of the game is kept in room storage. There's a debug endpoint so you can see the current state (you'll need to refresh the page to see changes). Go to [127.0.0.1:1999/party/announcer](http://127.0.0.1:1999/party/announcer) -- check out the the partyserver code for how this works.
